/*
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.


suppose both containers are of same height
if we move either - still height of existing will be the bottleneck

so if both containers have same height - move both pointers
