LC 92
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers
left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list
from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
You need to manage 4 moving parts:
idea:

reverse the sub list only
then turn / rotate it to connect to existing list
connect
beforePart: node before the reversed sublist
to
reversedHead: new head of reversed sublist
----------------------------------------------
connect
reversedTail (start of the reversed range)
to
current: where to reconnect the tail
