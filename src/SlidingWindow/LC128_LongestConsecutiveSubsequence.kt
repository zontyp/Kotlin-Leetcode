LC 128
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/
Given an unsorted array of integers nums,
 return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
idea:
we need to find start of sequence - if(!lookup.contains(n-1)){
and then check if next element is present
we need to avoid duplicates - so we use a set.
at each element - calculate current length and maxLength
