🎯 Problem:
Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s that contains all the characters in t (including duplicates).
If there is no such window, return an empty string "".

🧠 Algorithm:
expand (right++) → check if valid
if valid:
    shrink (left++) greedily → get smallest window ending at right
    update answer if better
repeat

💡 Idea:
This is a classic **sliding window** problem where we expand the window to include all characters in `t`,
then try to **shrink** it as much as possible while still keeping it valid.

👣 Real-World Analogies:

🧳 Messy Room Analogy:
- You're packing your bag (window in `s`) and need 3 things (characters in `t`) like 🪪passport, 🔋charger, 🪥toothbrush.
- Once your bag has everything ✅, you try to lighten it up (shrink the window).
- Whenever you reach a lighter valid bag, save it! That's your best answer so far.

🛒 Grocery Aisle Analogy:
- You're walking through aisles (string `s`) to pick up items on your list (string `t`: 🥛, 🍞, 🥚).
- You go forward until you have everything, then walk back from the start to skip unnecessary aisles.
- Save the shortest aisle span that satisfies your list.

📐 Sliding Window Pattern:
- `right` expands the window ➡️
- `left` shrinks the window ⬅️
