/*LC51
we place queen on each column of a row and check if we can find
required position
we place on first row and check , then on next row and so on
we come to know only by placing the queen , checking and backtracking

dfs / solve checks for each row
and fow loop checks for each column

ðŸ§  Big Picture First
The idea is to:

Try placing a queen row by row, one in each row.

For every position in the current row, check if placing a queen there is safe.

If yes, place it and go to the next row.

If not,backtrack and  try the next column.

When you reach currRow == totalRowCol,
 it means youâ€™ve successfully placed N queens â†’ record the board state as a solution.
