LC 253
 in meeting rooms - we just need to check if overlap is there or no
 in meeting room 2 - we need to count the number of overlaps
 overlaps may not be consecutive
 0,30
 5,10
 12,15

 12,15 is overlapping with 0,30 although they are not consecutive
 so if we just check consecutive - we miss out on that info
 so we store start time , end time as keys in a map , we sort the map
 and then add every value - the max value after adding any value is the result

 if we get start time - we add a room , if we get end time - we decrease a room . so we add start time, end time as keys in a map and sort the map .
for start time we add 1 to the value of the map
