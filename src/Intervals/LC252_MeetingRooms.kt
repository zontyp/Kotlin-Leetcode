package Intervals
/*
LC 252
overlapping means end of one interval should not be greater or equal to start of other interval.
so we need to check every pair with each other

but if we sort by start times - we need to check only each group of 2 intervals
a,b,c => sorted intervals
if a does not overlap with b
its guaranteed that a will not overlap with c
